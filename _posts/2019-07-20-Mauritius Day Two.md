## Our Guide

Before i kick this off I just want to shout out our guide and driver Billal, he was scheduled to pick us up at the airport last night and then offered his services for today and a tour of all the hotspots. He was an amazing guide and really knew his stuff when it came to his island. Helping out everyone he could along the way, seemingly knowing every person on the island also. He even guided us round which is in stark contrast to alot of the other drivers but more about that later....

## Big Fuck Off Hole
Otherwise known as Trou aux Cerfs although not officially dead it is a long dormant volcano, all that really remains when you get up there is a big hole in the ground thats nothing special, what is breath taking if you can cut through the other bus tours and tat sellers is the view. You can see across the whole island from up here and all the other mountains are visible. I took this panorama but some numpty got in the way....

## Big Deity's

Bigger than the hole, massive even, also a rather large part of Monica's heritage. This was a must visit, the Shiva statue was the original donated by the people of India to their descendants in Mauritius. It also hails from the same region in India as Monica, proud gujarati that she is.



## Chameral

Oh yes, finally some spirit to our spirits, we had a great tour and then we began our tasting, what can I say about this... Wel we mae some new friends, as one often does after drinking. We had tasters of everything they had to offer and ended up coming home with a bottle aged in Pedro Ximanez barrels, it was amazing. I wish I could have bought the ten year old but I can't justify $500 on a bottle of rum. Maybe when the business takes off Monica will treat me.  

## The Seven Sands...
Yeah Maybe in the dry, it was all the color of mud when we arrived, and never have I looked at a plateau of mud and thought, Wow this really commends an entry fee. Worst Tourism EVER.

## Shitty Drivers
So I said before I really wanted to shout out our driver, the real cement on this was the disgust and anger our drinking buddies endured from their driver. He was angry about the 2 hours spent drinking rum, he was even angrier at the seven colors of shite, He didnt even get out of the car at the waterfalls. Our guy taking the lead and looking after all four of us :d
