#Flying and Stop-overs.
Arriving at heathrow 6 hours early for your flight is a very me on travel day thing to do. This time however plans fell apart and as we grabbed our boarding passes Jasmine our check in lady asked if we wanted to take the flight that left in 45 minutes... We decided 6 hours in dubai was better than 4 in Heathrow and 3 in Dubai so took her up on her offer. We got the same seats and this was our first experience on a dreamliner, its bloody lovely. First time flyinig emirates too, staff were ok, meals were ok, drinks, well they were lacking a little. 

##Arriving Late
Arriving later than usually is never a surprise when travelling with the Patel, but for once, it wasnt her fault!! Our driver had hung around and waited nearly an hour for us to get through immigration etc. Whilst travelling to the hotel he was giving us a history of the island when Monica mentioned we had been hoping to go on a tour of the southwest and see some religious sites that were important to her. Our driver quickly offered to show us round and even take us out to the rhum distilleries. And so that is what I am currrently sitting and waiting for as I write this. I will write aother post this evening and hopefully get our image hosting up and running for a picture heavy first day in paradise.
