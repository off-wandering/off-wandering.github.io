Hi, welcome to our travel blog, I assume if you are here you know us. This is just a little way for us to keep track of our travels and to curate our pictures and experiences. 

### New Friends

If you have stumbled here and dont know either of us.

I am Sean, I work as an SAP contractor I went self employed at the start of 2019 mostly so I had the opportunity to travel and see some more of the world, there are only so many holidays to Manchester one couple can take.

My partner is Monica, she runs a small popup kitchen here in Bristol specialising in traditional Gujarati streetfood. [@NaastoBaasto](https://www.twitter.com/NaastoBaasto), she will be providing the majority of our images.
