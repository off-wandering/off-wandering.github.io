#The Beginning

Every story needs a good beginning, this is ours, we have been together a little over 13 years and in that time we have only ever had little jaunts across to Europe. Last year we both made the dive in to self employment and despite the risks and tightened belts, it is a decision that has really paid off for us.

##Planning

This is going to be brief because the conversation went like this :

    M: I want to see lots of wildlife
    S: loads of wildlife in madagascar
    M: Lets do it
    
Then I googled prices and shit myself, all i can say is this really will be once in a lifetime. We juggled routes and airlines around and eventually ended up planning to fly emirates, this meant we could spend a few days in Mauritius to get acclimatised before a small island hop to Madagascar. For the return trip we have decided to go via Johannesburg as it meant we could again fly emirates.

##Hindsight

So here we are starting off our journey, seems fitting that i am taking the same coach I have been taking to work the last few months, always envious of the other travellers and wondering where their suitcases would be jetting off to whilst I was shackled to the desk in corporate nowheres-ville. Hindsight being the wondrous thing it is I am almost regretting drinking a bottle of plantation rum last night, almost. And so our journey begins on a bus to catch a plane to fly to the other side of the world.
