title: The End of the Tour
---

After an amazing start the tour winds down to a rather disappointing end.


## Mantadia Lodge

This is the hotel all other hotels will forever be judged against, it was beautiful, the food was excellent and the location, set in the middle of a national park was nothing short of extraordinary. 

We briefly visited the Vokona Lodge resort so that we could see the Lemurs and view some Nile crocodiles that live in the reserves there, again this looked like an amazing hotel and I wish we could have explored more. 

Our bungalow was perfect the bed was soft, the shower was hot and had an amazing view..


If we had more time here I imagine a dip in the infinity pool or a glass of cold crisp white on our veranda would have been the perfect way to spend the day, But alas these first five days of our holidays were all about the activities not the relaxing. After an early night and a 5.30am start we were off again. Trekking through the Analamazaotra Primary Forest, looking for the Indri, the biggest and the loudest of the lemurs... 

## Palmarium - Ankanin’Nofy

Ankanin’Nofy - The Nest of Dreams, and by god is that needed, after you turn off the national 2 (Think motorway speeds with country lane maintenance) its a 7km off-road marathon. At the end of this road, sore arse and all is an absolute oasis where we stopped for lunch and waited on our boat to the hotel. This is where we said good bye to our driver of the last few days as he was heading back to Tana for a well deserved day off, after 250km anyways. 

People throw around the term rustic a lot to describe accommodation, here t is taken to the extreme. The warm water is provided via a fire, giving a shower experience that is best described as tepid. The electric is available for 4 hour a day through a single socket in the bathroom. The location though, the lemurs and meeting the illusive aye-aye, make all those things fade away. This was the best experience we had so far and made the entire ‘safari’ trip worth its price and then some.

 


## Palm Resort

Meant to be a quick one night stop over, due to our ferry being cancelled turned in to two days in what can only be described as accommodation from hell. The driver / receptionist was the first person on this trip to beg for a tip, stand there until it became uncomfortable. I overtipped everywhere I could on this trip but that man really wound me up. 

The town of Toamisina is an experience,  it felt safer than Tana, although I have been informed since it is far worse. Our hotel decided Wednesday nights the restaurant was closed which meant we had our first experience of Malagasy Pizza. It’s amazing, they make great pizza. 

To save us from a potential third night in this hole we chartered a flight to leave Thursday morning leaving us only a day behind our plans. This was an unfortunate end to an otherwise amazing trip.
