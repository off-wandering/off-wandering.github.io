##Our Guide
Before i kick this off I just want to shout out our guide and driver Billal, he was scheduled to pick us up at the airport last night and then offered his services for today and a tour of all the hotspots. He was an amazing guide and really knew his stuff when it came to his island. Helping out everyone he could along the way, seemingly knowing every person on the island also. He even guided us round which is in stark contrast to alot of the other drivers but more about that later....

##Big Fuck Off Hole
Otherwise known as Trou aux Cerfs although not officially dead it is a long dormant volcano, all that really remains when you get up there is a big hole in the ground thats nothing special, what is breath taking if you can cut through the other bus tours and tat sellers is the view. You can see across the whole island from up here and all the other mountains are visible. I took this panorama but some numpty got in the way....
