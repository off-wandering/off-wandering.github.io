## Flying and Stop-overs.


Arriving at heathrow 6 hours early for your flight is a very me on travel day thing to do. This time however plans fell apart and as we grabbed our boarding passes Jasmine our check in lady asked if we wanted to take the flight that left in 45 minutes... We decided 6 hours in dubai was better than 4 in Heathrow and 3 in Dubai so took her up on her offer. We got the same seats and this was our first experience on a dreamliner, its bloody lovely. First time flying emirates too, staff were ok, meals were ok, drinks, well they were lacking a little. 

As it turns out 6 hours in Dubai in the middle of the night is not a great experience, it was hot and sticky and so were we, I was still waiting on an invoice to clear so we didnt have a great deal of cash and I was the worst person to be travelling with, honestly dont know how that girl puts up with me at times, must be my good looks and charm... 

We ended up drinking over priced juice, eating a Mcdonalds that needed a remortgage to cover the cost of... But at least it was a different menu to the uk. Monica had an arabian chicken, which seemed to just be a chopped up chicken burger lathered in mayo and served in a wrap, I had what can only be described as a big mac but with chicken, again the mayo was fucking everywhere. The big plus for me was that they still do large meals here so I had a bucket of proper e number triggering fanta and monica had apple tango, enough sugar to get us through the next leg of our journey.

Now I am going to sound two things, old and very British, when did people forget how they should queue??? First they called for first class, fair enough you paid enoough extra knock yourself out. Then they called for Families with children..OK Great, give my ears a rest before I am forced to sit in a metal tube with your little fucking angel screaming at me. Then they called sections A, B and C which apparently in a memo I had missed meant fucking free for all melee of epic proportions. We sat back observing this, I fail to understand the need to get on the plane sooner, like 6 hours isnt going to be long enough... Anyway we got here eventually.

## Arriving Late.

Arriving later than usually is never a surprise when travelling with the Patel, but for once, it wasnt her fault!! Our driver had hung around and waited nearly an hour for us to get through immigration etc. 

Pro-tip: Make sure you have your life story carefully prepared with every travel document ever written in your pocket when speaking to the immigration police, especially if only staying a few days....

Whilst travelling to the hotel Billal(Our driver) was giving us a history of the island when Monica mentioned we had been hoping to go on a tour of the southwest and see some religious sites that were important to her. Our driver quickly offered to show us round and even take us out to the rhum distilleries. And so that is what I am currrently sitting and waiting for as I write this. I will write aother post this evening and hopefully get our image hosting up and running for a picture heavy first day in paradise.
