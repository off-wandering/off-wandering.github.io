# Arriving in Madagascar

## At Home

As mentioned previously this trip all happened a bit on a whim, we had contacted a couple of tour guides but found their prices to be extravagant at best and at worst bankrupting. I found Cederberg whilst googling for how to travel to ile saint marie. They offer a tour which includes a few days on the island so set about sending an email that would get us there and then leave us to make our own way back.

Ian got back to me in very short time, I had left all this to less than a month before travel so I imagine I had put his back a little against the wall with this. We agreed a prices and the tour was planned, we would be met from the airport and had an exciting itinerary planned. 

## The Plan

So we would sped a couple of days in Mauritius to get our bearings and break up what would have otherwise been a very long period of travelling. Once we landed in Madagascar, everything for the first few days would already be arranged for us. 

We would be met at the airport by a representative of the tour company (Island Continent Tours) and she would walk us through our activities for the next few days. 

## Airport shenanigans

Tana airport is by far the least secure airport I have ever been through. We arrived and stupidly I had assumed I could pay for my VISA by card, you cant, you have to have cash. Also how much you pay for the visa seems to differ depending on how much the given guard likes or dislikes you.... I was walked past passport control and in to the unsecured side of the airport, with my bags, to draw some cash from the cash points. Neither of these points were working at the time, so I had to phone our travel operator in Madagascar ([https://ictours.mg](Island Continent Tours)) they managed to send out someone with the money and I paid him back as soon as we were able to get to a cash point. 

## Palissandre Hotel - Tana

We only spent one night in Tana and tbh I found the whole thing a little overwhelming, we went for an early morning walk to the cash point and the whole city seemed to be screaming with car horns and activity, I was in sensory overload and if Monica hadn’t been with me I may not have held it together at all. 

The hotel itself was lovely if a little dated, I had nothing to compare it to at this point, the bed was comfy and the mini bar plentiful and cheap. Tried my first beer from Three Horses Brewery, its tastes a little like shandy bass and I’m not convinced, in this heat, that is a bad thing.

The Morning after we met our driver and began the long 3+ hours drive to our next destination, we had a little hiccup along the way : The rear diff on our land cruiser blew itself in to 100 little bits, a job I am certain would take a few days and some over night parts in the UK was fixed with a hammer and some old washers and the princely sum of $2.50.
